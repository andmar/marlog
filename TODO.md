# TODO
 * Allow for logging to multiple Stamps on the same call
 * Consider making the Logging functions package based instead of attached to the main object so the "calling code's line" is smaller
 * If provided Stamp/Handler does not exist? Default to log to stdout? Or Log an Error to STDOUT
 * Remove "Log" from the log functions to reduce verbosity and "log.Log..." usage weirdness
